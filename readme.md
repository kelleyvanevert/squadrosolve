# Squadro

Rust code to play [Squadro](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245222/squadro). Can think 10 steps ahead in about 1.5 seconds. Has won two times again humans so far :P

How to use:

- Input the current state of the board in `input.txt`
- Run `cargo run --release` to see what yellow should play next :)
